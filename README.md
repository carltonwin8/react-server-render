# Server Side Rendering With React

I use this repository as a react html templating system.
The code in this repository is based on:
[Server-side rendering with React.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k66bOHX8MnY).
In order to get javascript in the react components working implement the
following tutorial:
[Building a universal/isomorphic web app with React.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uf1Vk3RnXsk);
